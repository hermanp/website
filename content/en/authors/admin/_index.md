Greetings! Please, have a look around!  
  
I share multiple thigs under the [Resources](/en/resources/) tab: my bookmarks, books worth reading, articles, news and ideas — basically everything which spurred my interest. From these, a post may arise under [Posts](/en/post/), but there can be found a description about creating this website. Things spanning through multiple posts and having a start and end can be find under the [Projects](/en/project/) tab. I share my [resume](/en/files/resume_en.pdf) and [CV](/en/files/CV_en.pdf) also.
