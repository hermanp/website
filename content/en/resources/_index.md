The resources page is a collection of my bookmarks, books, articles, news and ideas â€” basically everything which spurred my interest. I may refer to these in posts. Inspired by the site of [Jaan Tollander de Balsch](https://jaantollander.com/) and made possible by the ["Book"](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-a-course-or-book) content type of the Academic Hugo theme (from v5).
